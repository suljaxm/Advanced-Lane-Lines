# Advanced Lane Finding
---
In this project, which is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video, and my implementation steps in [writeup.md](https://github.com/suljaxm/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup.md).

## The Project
---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
In the current path, you can run the project as follows:
```
jupyter notebook
```
